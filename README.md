# Knights Tour

Info about the Knights Tour problem as described by wikipedia:

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that 
the knight visits every square only once. If the knight ends on a square that 
is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board 
again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed, otherwise it 
is open.
